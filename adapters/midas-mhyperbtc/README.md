# Midas mHyperBTC

Tracks [Midas mHyperBTC](https://midas.app/mhyperbtc), a BTC-denominated tokenized certificate managed by Hyperithm. Investors hold an ERC-20; return accrues through NAV rather than a separate reward token.

Midas wires mHyperBTC as a direct-only LayerZero pathway from Ethereum to Monad. Rootstock is a separate native deployment with its own issuance and redemption contracts.

## TVL

```text
tvlBtc = token.totalSupply() * dataFeed.getDataInBase18() / 1e18
```

`getDataInBase18()` is the official Midas NAV, scaled to 18 decimals. The adapter reads token decimals on-chain instead of assuming 18.

Headline TVL is Ethereum-only. That matches the issuance home and avoids mixing Rootstock's native book or assuming LayerZero burn/mint accounting before those supplies are verified.

Live Ethereum check on 2026-08-19: `totalSupply = 287.005370386145`, `NAV = 1.02455304` BTC per token, so `tvlBtc ≈ 294.05`. RWA.xyz still screens `7D APY = 2.05%` and `30D APY = 2.75%`; its Ethereum supply snapshot on that page lagged the live contract by about `0.69` tokens.

## APY

Headline `apr` is the 7-day compounded NAV APY, which is the same window RWA.xyz labels `7D APY`.

```text
growth = navNow / nav7dAgo
apy7d = (growth ^ (365 / actualElapsedDays) - 1) * 100
```

The adapter also stores the 30-day compounded APY in metadata. If the RPC cannot serve the 7-day historical read, it falls back to the 30-day window. If both fail, the adapter throws instead of writing `apr = 0`.

The strategy is actively managed, so a trailing NAV window can legitimately go negative. The headline `apr` is floored at 0 with the raw figure kept in `metadata.rawNavApy`, and `metadata.allowZeroApr` is set only when the raw figure is negative — a frozen NAV feed reading exactly 0 growth still fails loudly in normalize. Same pattern as the yb-\*-yieldbearing adapters.

## Environment

```bash
BITCOINYIELD_RPC_ETHEREUM=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
```

Archive or reasonably deep history is required for the 7-day and 30-day NAV windows. Public fallbacks may fail the historical reads.

## Cost estimate

About 8 JSON-RPC calls per hour:

- 1 multicall for `totalSupply`, `decimals`, and `getDataInBase18`
- latest block
- 7-day historical NAV + block
- 30-day historical NAV + block
